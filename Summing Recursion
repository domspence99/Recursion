//1. what is the function trying to do?
//sum the numbers of the function then send return to sumNum

//2. when does the recursion need to end?
//whenever all of the elements have been summed
//i.e when n has recursively reached 0 (base case)

//3. Body, use the logic to get correct output



//4. Recursion
return n + sumNum(n-1); //loop back to print elements with n-1
